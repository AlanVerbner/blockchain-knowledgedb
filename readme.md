# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alan. I'm a software engineer. I've co-founded [Atix](https://www.atixlabs.com) and spent the past 6 years working on blockchain related projects (protocols, DApps, integrations, research). 

I consider myself lucky enough to have been paid to spend my time learning and exploring fascinating topics but sadly I haven't had the time to formally document what I've read or learnt. Here, I'm forcing myself to write everything down for my own benefit but I hope you find something new or interesting.

I'll be mostly writing about anything related to blockchain technology [[Protocols]], [[DApps]] (mostly [[Solidity]] based), NFTs, Governance or anything I find worth remembering.
